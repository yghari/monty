0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Description
This repository contains solutions to the tasks and projects of the "0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO" module of the Low-Level Programming section of the ALX curriculum.

The projects in this repository focus on implementing stack and queue data structures using the C programming language. The primary goal is to understand the concepts of LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structures, and to practice their implementation in C.
